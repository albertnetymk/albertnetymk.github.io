philosophically.</p>
</li>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/B8083">The future of Visual Studio</a> I was most amazed by the voice-oriented programming and windows
subsystem for Linux parts.</p>

<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVdBPvOOjBA">Partial Derivatives of Regular Expressions</a> Surprisingly, I find this talk fairly easy to follow.
Since the new approach promises simpler logic and better performance (in certain cases), I wonder if there’s major re-write for current RE lib. (I
didn’t find the repo for this work.)</p>

ipython (the python notebook). However, by utilizing JS, and custom html input, it seems this approach is even more powerful. Either way, I am not
touching visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyfBQmvr2Hc">William Byrd on “The Most Beautiful Program Ever Written”</a> In the line of SICP, but I think the style
used in <a href="http://albertnetymk.github.io/2016/07/31/simple_interpreter/">r2</a> is cleaner. The latter part, where he shows how to synthesis program via

<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twQKAoq2OPE">Python, Linkers, and Virtual Memory</a> It’s titled Python, but the points are much more general. Really

tools, but still it feels quite awkward. I wonder if we can have reasonable C-like speed in Erlang, then we don’t need to call C from Erlang any
more.</p>

<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpp-8gkPWVE">Meteor.js with Matt Debergalis</a> The idea of caching complete or partial DB on the client side seems
quite neat. I have never done any collaborating web apps, so really don’t know much about this topic, but I will give it a try if I encounter such
opportunity.</p>

<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5Ti0r8Q2s">MuniHac 2016: Beautiful folds are practical, too</a> The standard derivation example is rather
convincing. The idea of composing folds and apply them in the end reminds me of parser combinator. Considering that FP promotes composing small
functions to achieve large functionality, this should not be too surprising, but still it’s pretty neat.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Seth-Juarez/Anders-Hejlsberg-on-Modern-Compiler-Construction">Anders Hejlsberg on Modern Compiler Construction</a> The
front end part of a compiler should be extracted, and renamed to language engine or something like for it could answer queries on the code base. As
for the on-the-fly AST construction + typechecking, I didn’t fully catch what he explained. My personal idea would be to identify the block
boundaries (module, class, or method), so that info from other unmodified blocks could be reused. Maybe it’s the same (or very similar) to what he
explained on reusing AST nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os7FE3J-U5Q">Andy Keep - Writing a Nanopass Compiler </a> The nanopass framework is quite neat; maybe it can be done
in Haskell with less quirky syntax. In fact, with map fusion, it should be possible to keep the neatness of having nanopass without the high
overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t86v3N4OshQ">The S.O.L.I.D. Principles of OO and Agile Design - by Uncle Bob Martin</a> It’s new to me that
polymorphism (programming against interface) is so ubiquitous and powerful. The VS plugin example is very inspiring, that it’s possible to add new
features without modifying the existing code. Function pointers are used behind the scene to implement polymorphism. As it’s pointed out that C has
polymorphism (e.g. getchar), but it’s comparatively more verbose to use.</p>

it’s not very clear to me why. This talk pinpoints the non-inductiveness of graph, which makes it not a good candidate for algebraic data type.</p>

values in our program, there’s no reason why we couldn’t do the same with types. <code>Kinds</code> in Haskell is one approach for this, but it’s quite
primitive compared with what we can do with values. There’s clear boundary between values and types in Haskell, but Idris treat them in the same
way. Not sure if it’s good; consistency or complexity.</p>
