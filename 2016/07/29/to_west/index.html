<p>When We were called Sick man of Asia, We were called The Yellow Peril.</p>
<p>When We are billed to be the next Superpower, We are called The threat.</p>
<p>When We were closed our doors, You smuggled Drugs to Open Markets.</p>
<p>When We Embrace Freed Trade, You blame us for Taking away your jobs.</p>
<p>When We were falling apart, You marched in your troops and wanted your “fair share”.</p>
<p>When We were putting the broken pieces together again, “Free Tibet” you screamed, “it was an invasion!”</p>
<p>So, We Tried Communism, You hated us for being Communists</p>
<p>When We embrace Capitalism, You hate us for being Capitalist.</p>
<p>When We have a Billion People, you said we were destroying the planet.</p>
<p>When We are tried limited our numbers, you said It was human rights abuse.</p>
<p>When We were Poor, You think we are dogs.</p>
<p>When We Loan you cash, You blame us for your debts.</p>
<p>When We build our industries, You called us Polluters.</p>
<p>When we sell you goods, You blame us for global warming.</p>
<p>When We buy oil, You called that exploitation and Genocide.</p>
<p>When You fight for oil, You called that Liberation.</p>
<p>When We were lost in Chaos and rampage, You wanted Rules of Law for us.</p>
<p>When We uphold law and order against Violence, You called that Violating Human Rights.</p>
<p>When We were silent, You said you want us to have Free Speech.</p>
<p>When We were silent no more, You say we were Brainwashed-Xenophobics.</p>
<p>Why do you hate us so much? We asked.</p>
<p>“No,” You Answered, “We don’t hate You.”</p>
<p>We don’t Hate You either,</p>
<p>But Do you understand us?</p>
<p>“Of course We do,” You said,</p>
<p>“We have AFP, CNN and BBCs…”</p>
<p>What do you really want from us?</p>
<p>Think Hard first, then Answer…</p>
<p>Because you only get so many chances,</p>
<p>Enough is Enough, Enough Hypocrisy for this one world.</p>
<p>We want One World, One Dream, And Peace On Earth.</p>
<p>This Big Blue Earth is Big Enough for all of Us.</p>
