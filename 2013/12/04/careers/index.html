    <blockquote>
<p>That will just be a completely unintentional side effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I am qualified to give any advice on career management, so this
post will merely contain my personal reflection on what’s happening recently to
me. Today, I got some reply, which is not one rejection letter, from job
application, after around one year job seeking.</p>
<h2 id="Attractive-CV-resume"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Attractive-CV-resume">§</a>Attractive CV/resume</h2>
<p>One doubt I have always had is why my resume couldn’t even pass the first round
of HR filtering, especially when I heard some of my friends get a lot replies
after submitting job applications. Having hubris as one my characteristic, I
don’t think I am any less skillful than them as one developer. After receiving
tons of rejection letters, I could not stand but asking one of my good friends,
who is among the “God favored” group, why this is happening to me. He didn’t
provided much valuable info for this issue, but gave his resume to me as one
reference. I was impressed by his resume, and couldn’t connect the person this
resume is describing with the person in front of me. If I am the HR, I will
definitely inform any applicants with this kind of resume. I took one copy of
his resume and planed to study it at home carefully.</p>
<h2 id="Pretend-to-be-attractive"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Pretend-to-be-attractive">§</a>Pretend to be attractive</h2>
<p>I read through the copy of his resume again and again, trying to identify what’s
missing in my resume. One peculiar thing I notice when I read his resume was
that I couldn’t remember anything in the resume after reading it. The only thing
left on my mind is that this applicant is good somehow, but nothing else. I am
not sure why I got this feeling, but, as far as I understand, resume should
provide HR with the info about the applicant so that he or she could evaluate if
the applicant matches the applied position. If one resume just convey some
subjective info like the applicant is good, but fail do deliver any objective
info, it shouldn’t be considered as one good one. Once realizing the
philosophical difference between him and me, I lost the interest in applying his
style into my resume.</p>
<h2 id="Subjectiveness-vs-Objectiveness"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Subjectiveness-vs-Objectiveness">§</a>Subjectiveness vs Objectiveness</h2>
<p>The two should be complementary, and no one is better that the other. However,
it’s very likely, one person is biased to one during certain period of time. I
guess I lean to the latter while my friend lean to the formal. As I said, they
are different, but no one is superior to the other. If one’s happy with one,
they don’t need to switch. Please don’t switch just because the other might lead
to quick success.</p>
<h2 id="Be-yourself"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Be-yourself">§</a>Be yourself</h2>
<p>I guess I am kind of rational guy, and prefer reading objective info and writing
objective info. It wouldn’t be me any more if I merely mimicking others just
because this might provide more opportunities. The only valid reason why we are
mimicking others should be we admire that person, and see ourselves in him or
her. After realizing this, I calmed myself down by saying “There will be bread.
There will be milk”. Then I made my mind that I will continue to be myself, keep
my principle, and hope for the best. Maybe something good will happen. Who know.</p>
<h2 id="Attitude"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Attitude">§</a>Attitude</h2>
<p>I don’t have any proof that something good will come or this will lead to
success even one choose to be themselves. However, one should have such attitude
that success is merely one bonus (side effect) to what one does. Be yourself and
check for the side effect.</p>
