    <p>From today, my blog is finally up. One of the reasons why it’s taking so much time is I couldn’t find one suitable blogging platform. I guess I could
give a comparison on some technologies I have used or assessed in the process.</p>
<h2 id="In-browser-Editing"><a class="header-anchor" href="#In-browser-Editing">§</a>In-browser Editing</h2>
<p>Wordpress is probably the most widely used platform, originating from blogging and remaining the number one choice for the majority. However, I didn’t
so inclined to write much text outside of my editor, so I gave up after composing several posts. Somehow I came across this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform">Ghost kickstarter
video</a> while surfing on the Internet, and was truly amazed by its
elegance and dazzling themes. However, its delivery date was far fetched so I had to continue my seeking.</p>
<h2 id="Publishing-Files-in-Cloud"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Publishing-Files-in-Cloud">§</a>Publishing Files in Cloud</h2>
<p>I had to admit that I was very happy when I firstly found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://postach.io/">Postach</a>, and believe that it would revolutionize the blogging
community. However, some of my posts were weirdly formatted, and I spent quite much time before locating the real culprit, Evernote, which does <em>not</em>
store notes as plain text files, but instead as HTML files. Giving up composing plain text files is not acceptable for me, especially for technical
posts containing code snippets, so I had to say goodbye.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://Scriptogr.am">Scriptogr.am</a> serves files from Dropbox just like Postach serving files from Evernote. However, in Dropbox, files are stored as text files, written in
markdown. I used this solution until they decided to terminate their service.</p>
<h2 id="Github-Pages-Hexo"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Github-Pages-Hexo">§</a>Github Pages + Hexo</h2>
<p>Github page is advocated as one great alternate to Wordpress for blogging, and in fact, a lot of cool people are using it. Personally, I feel using
git for blogging is like making a mountain out of a molehill, especially the history of an post is not of interest mostly. I believe it’s too tedious
to create a commit just for some trivial typing change.</p>
<p>However, on revisiting Github Pages after leaving <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://Scriptogr.am">Scriptogr.am</a>, I realized that I don’t have to use git <em>manually</em>; instead, I could view Github Pages
as a hosting site for static html files. This way I can just set up an cron job to invoke a static site generator followed by <code>git commit ; git push</code>.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a> lists some popular static site generators, which I skimmed through, and ended up with
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>, for it’s written in JS.</p>
